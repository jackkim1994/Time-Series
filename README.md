# Time Series
<p>This repository is specifically for Time Series group projects I have completed in **UCLA Economics 144: Economic Forecasting.**</p>

<h2>Project 1: Number of Calls in Eugene, Oregon</h2>
<p>One of the challenges for the first project is utilizing time seires fundamentals we learned in the class to analyze the data and its trend.</p>
<p>The Number of Police Calls, interestingly, dropped significantly between 2013-2014. This is porbably due to the change in the categorization of reporting crimes. The switch was made from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) format to Oregon National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS).</p>
