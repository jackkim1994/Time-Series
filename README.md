# Time_Series
This repository is specifically for Time Series class projects I am currently taking in **UCLA Economics 144: Economic Forecasting.**
I will update the project whenever I successfully complete the project with my group.

<h2>Project 1: Number of Calls in Eugene, Oregon</h2>
<p>One of the challenges for the first project is to utilize theories we learned in the class to the actual time series analysis.</p>
<p>The Number of Police Calls, interestingly, dropped significantly between 2013-2014.</p>
